This is a work-in-progress HTTP/2 implementation for Go.

It will eventually live in the Go standard library and won't require
any changes to your code to use.  It will just be automatic.

Status:

* The server support is pretty good. A few things are missing
  but are being worked on.
* The client work has just started but shares a lot of code
  is coming along much quicker.

Docs are at https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/net/http2

Demo test server at https://http2.golang.org/
